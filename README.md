## Overview of the Analysis

Created a pretty accurate machine learning model used to predict healthy or high-risk loans.

First step was separating insance information including collected measures on
loan data (loan amount, interest rate, derogatory marks) &
borrower information (income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, & total debt)
from whether it was categorized as healthy or high risk.
Using a Logistic Regression Model, the collected measures are used to predict whether
future loans in similar instances will be high-risk or healthy loans.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
 that had a balanced accuracy of 95% with an overall accuracy rating of 99%.


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
