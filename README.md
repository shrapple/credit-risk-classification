## Overview of the Analysis

Looking to predict healthy vs high-risk loans by looking at previously
collected instance's loan data (loan amount, interest rate, derogatory marks) & borrower information (income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, & total debt). Each categorized as healthy (0) or high risk (1).
Using a Logistic Regression Model, the collected measures are then used to predict whether future loans in similar instances will be high-risk or healthy.


## Results

It's important to note that the data was imbalanced. Out of 77,536 instances; 75,036 were healthy and 2,500 were high-risk

* Model Accuracy: 
  * The model scored 99% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy
* Model Precision:
  * The model was least precise when predicting high risk loans at 85%
  * Healthy loans scored a shocking 100%. This could be due to the imbalance.
* Model Recall:
  * Healthy loan recall was 99%
  * High-risk loan recall was 91% 


## Summary

Overall, this machine learning model performed really well. 

The number of predicted healthy but categorized as high-risk loans is **nearly half** the number of actual healthy loans predicted to be high-risk.

The number of missed high-risk loans was **a tenth** of the predicted high-risk loans that were actually healthy loans.

I certainly recommend this model as a tool with the understanding that the high-risk data isn't necessarily as represented as it needs to be to be able to accurately categorize them as so. Meaning, even if you get an instance that could be predicted as high-risk, it's important to take in more factors if receiving a high-risk score.
